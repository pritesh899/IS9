# Motivation

We formulated two questions during our learning to this point: What would a
Bayes network look like if the DAG constraint were loosened to allow
undirected and possibly cyclical graphs? Further, we wondered if there were a
way to resolve the absolute nature of first order logic with the uncertainty of
real-world problems.

In our exploration related to these questions, we came across a 2006
publication by Richardson and Domingos which describes the notion of a Markov
logic network. MLNs expand the idea of Markov random fields with first-order
logic to provide a way to model knowledge in ways that a Bayesian network
cannot.
